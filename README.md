# GeekMountain:- WDI Conf

'Geek Mountain' is the project name for the demonstration build of a Twitter based charity/networking integratin web app: the concept is predicatied on the notion of creating arbitray teams out of a conferences participants and forcing one of the poor misbegotten members to climb a Mountain for charity(charity events like the White Lion Three Peaks Challange or the Oxfam Walk are good candidates).  The actual distance convered by the groups designatesd 'Walker' is dictated by an arbitray success metric as defined by the event organisers and the progress of each team and individual is displayed in a real time graph.

The progress, trails and general pain and suffering of the 'Walker' is to be displayed in a real time stream of an even organiser controlled Twitter account: the Twitter stream updates in real time and as such does not require a page refresh; this makes it perfect for display and forget at an event.

The app makes use of the Twit library created by Tolga Tezel. https://github.com/ttezel/twit and will include a to be determined social media plugin.
